## playlist  
A few shell scripts to play your audio collection and provide artist &amp; song title with timer in your panel

I wrote these scripts so I can quickly start listening to my locally stored music without having to open up the VLC gui or type a string of commands in the temrinal. mapped the play script to a keyboard shortcut for quick launching. 

subsequently addded the nowplaying script so i can see song info and time remaining easily.  using generic monitor plugin (xfce DE) to display the /tmp file with the media information.

From Terminal  
play will queue up your locally stored audio files and play them  
play- will allow you to choose a specific artist or song
