# playlist
A few shell scripts to play your audio collection and provide artist &amp; song name with time left in your panel

I wrote these scripts so I can quickly start a playlist without having to open up the VLC gui or type many commands in the temrinal.  can be started from terminal of course, but i have mapped the play script to a keyboard shortcut for quick starting. 

subsequeently addded the nowplaying script so i can see song info and time remaining easily.  using generic monitor plugin (xfce DE) to display the /tmp file with the media information.
